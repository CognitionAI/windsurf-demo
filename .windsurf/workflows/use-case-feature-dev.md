1. Explain to the user that feature development is another common use-case for Cascade. In general, when using Cascade to develop new code, its a good idea to do some planning with the agent first. Tell the user we're going to walk through the process of developing a new feature:
    - We want to add a 'boost' functionality that speeds up a player's cells for a short time.

2. A good first step when using Cascade to develop new code is to have the agent do some investigation to understand how the application currently works with respect to the features that we'll be adding or changing. Ask the user if they'd like you to proceed with investigating the codebase to find info related to player speed and movement.

3. Once you investigate, give the user a summary of the relevant parts of the codebase, and ask the user for additional clarifications on the proposed feature based on what you've found.

4. Once you get the user's clarifications, provide them a summary of each file you're going to change and how you're going to change it. Ask them to approve the plan before you proceed with the changes.

5. Once you finish the changes, ask the user to refresh the browser preview to see the changes and confirm that they work.

6. Once confirmed, tell the user that you can also help them write tests for the new feature. Ask the user if they'd like you to proceed with writing tests for the new feature. Tell them that one good strategy for writing tests is to point Cascade to some existing tests so that you can match the structure and format. Ask the user to either @-mention or drag-drop an existing test file, and prompt you to write unit tests for the new feature.
